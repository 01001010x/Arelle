Description: Arelle is a project to provide an easy to use open source facility for XBRL.
        
        The intent began to meet needs that are not commercially viable, such as to
        support under-development extension modules and test suite facilities, in a
        compact framework, and to support academic training and projects.
        
        Support for XBRL versioning was an initial goal, to provide both a validation
        tool for versioning reports and a production tool to generate the basics of a
        versioning report that can be inferred by diffing two DTSes.
        
        As the project evolved, Edgar and Global Filer Manual validation, Base
        Specification, Dimensions, Generic linkbase, Formula validation and an 
        RSS Watch facility were added.
        
        Arelle fully integrates test cases with the object models for XBRL instances and
        DTSes.
        
        This allows continual verification of tool performance as it is extended and
        adapted by its users.
        
        Users can explore the functionality and features from either an interactive GUI
        or command line interface, and can develop their own controller interfaces as
        needed.
        
        Arelle is supported on the website: http://arelle.org/
